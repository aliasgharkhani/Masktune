<h1>MaskTune: Mitigating Spurious Correlations by Forcing to Explore</h1>
This is an official pytorch implementation of <a href="https://duckduckgo.com" target="_blank"><em>MaskTune: Mitigating Spurious Correlations by Forcing to Explore</em></a>, <strong>NeurIPS 2022</strong>. MaskTune is a technique for mitigating shortcut learning in machine learning algorithms.

<h1>How to use</h1>

1. Clone the code (now you should have a folder named MaskTune)
2. Inside `MaskTune/` create `datasets/` folder
3. For `catsvsdogs`, `CelebA`, `inl9 (the Background Challenge)`, `Waterbirds` expriments, inside `MaskTune/datasets/` create `catsvsdogs/raw/`, `CelebA/raw/`, `in9l/raw/`, and `Waterbirds/raw/` folders. For other datasets (i.e., cifar10, mnist, and svhn) you don't need to do anything.
4. Download the dataset you want (you don't need to download cifar10, mnist, and svhn because they will be downloaded automatically). You can download the <strong>corrected version of the Waterbirds dataset</strong> from <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J5hrpg9j7XdKKrIUMfd80j0HoBEwlbb4/view?usp=sharing">here</a> (The original Waterbirds dataset has some label and image noise).
4. To run an experiment, use the bash files in `MaskTune/bash_files`. First, change the second line of the bash file to the path of `MaskTune` folder (e.g., `downloads/MaskTune`). You have to set `base_dir` to the path of `MaskTune/` folder and `dataset_dir` to the path of corresponding dataset (e.g., for celebA set this to `{base_dir}/datasets/CelebA/raw`)
